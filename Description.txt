This file implements an advanced archery simulation application using Streamlit. Here's a summary of the key components and features:

### Physics and Utility Functions
1. **Constants**:
   - Gravity (`G`), air density, and air viscosity are defined.
   - Drag coefficient factors for different arrow tip types are provided.

2. **Physics Calculations**:
   - Functions to calculate Reynolds number, drag coefficient, and forward-of-center (FOC).
   - A function to calculate the arrow's initial velocity based on input parameters like draw force, mass, and efficiency.

3. **Trajectory Simulation**:
   - Simulates the arrow's path considering factors like gravity, drag, and initial velocity.
   - Includes functions to interpolate trajectory points and find the optimal launch angle for hitting a target.

4. **Posture and Launch Adjustments**:
   - Functions to calculate the arrow's launch height based on archer posture and biomechanics.
   - Iterative method to converge on the optimal launch angle and height.

### Visualization
- **Trajectory Plotting**:
  - Plots the arrow's trajectory with and without drag.
  - Includes annotations for target position, drop from the line of sight, and other metrics.

### Streamlit Interface
- **Arrow Parameters**:
  - Inputs for mass, length, diameter, spine, balance point, and tip type.

- **Bow Parameters**:
  - Inputs for draw force, draw length, efficiency, and bow type.

- **Archer Biometry and Posture**:
  - Inputs for launch height, anchor length, pelvis height, eye offset, and posture.

- **Target Parameters**:
  - Inputs for target distance and height.

- **Options**:
  - Choices to use measured velocity, show line of sight, and compare trajectories with and without drag.

- **Simulation Execution**:
  - Calculates optimal launch angle and trajectory.
  - Displays results including trajectory plot, optimal angle, flight time, and estimated efficiency.

Overall, this script provides a comprehensive simulation tool for analyzing and visualizing archery ballistics.
